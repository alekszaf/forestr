## forestr

The forestr package calculates forest structure and canopy structure metrics from multiple data forms, including two-dimensional portable canopy LiDAR (PCL) raw data files and from certain processed three-dimensional terrestrial LiDAR scanner (TLS) data forms. 

## Installation
To install the development version
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("atkinsjeff/forestr")
```

## Usage
To process raw PCL data, which comes in .csv form as two columns:  column one is a string of numbers that represent return distance in meters, and column two is a string of integers that represent return intensity. 

You can run an example data set that is included, a 40 m forest transect from Ordway-Swisher Biological Station in Hawthorn, FL.

The `process_pcl` function writes data to an output folder that is created in the working directory.

```{r eval = FALSE}

require(forestr)

process_pcl(osbs)
```

The output includes:

1) an output.csv file that contains 24 canopy structral complexity (CSC) metrics including rumple, canopy rugosity, and max canopy height. These metrics are defined in [Hardiman et al. 2013](http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/4/3/537/htm).

2) an output_hit_matrix.csv file that is a file that contains the adjusted VAI by x and z position in the canopy. 

3) a summary_matrix.csv file that gives the mean height, max heights, VAI and variance metrics by each columnar position, or x position along the transect. 


## Plotting

The forestr package also produces hit grids--vegetation area index (VAI) for by 1 squared meter bins on the x and z axis through the canopy.
